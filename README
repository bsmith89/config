This repository is a set of customized configuration files which I
have found to be useful on a variety of systems.  I have a separate
branch for each system, currently just OSX and the HPCC at MSU.

Files in the virtualenvwrapper/ directory are hooks which should be placed in a
.virtualenvwrapper/ directory in the $HOME directory in order to be run by
virtualenvwrapper when starting/stopping/etc. a virtualenv.

ipython_notebook_config.py should be placed in a .ipython/ directory in the
$HOME directory to change the default setting for ipython notebook.
